## Finite linear space

```ad-definition
title: Finite Linear Space

A (finite) linear space over a set $X$ is a family $\mathcal L$ of its subsets called its *lines*, such that:
1. every line contains at least two points, and
2. any two points are on exactly one line.

## Design theory

In the language of design theory, 

## De Bruijn - Erdos Theorem

The [[Finite Linear Spaces Have More Lines Than Points#De Bruijn - Erdos Theorem|theorem]] states that finite linear spaces have at least as many lines as they do points, with equality if and only if any two lines share exactly one point.
