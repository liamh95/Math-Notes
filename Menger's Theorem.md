```ad-theorem
title: Menger's Theorem (Undirected Vertex Version)

In any graph $G$ where $x$ and $y$ are nonadjacent, the maximum number of pairwise internally disjoint $xy$-paths is equal to the minimum number of vertices in an $xy$-[[Vertex Cut#Vertex Cut|vertex-cut]]. In terms of the [[k-Connectivity#Local Connectivity|local connectivity]] and [[Vertex Cut#Local Cut Function|local cut]] functions,
$$
p(x,y) = c(x,y).
