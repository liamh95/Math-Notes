```ad-theorem
title: Kuratowski's Theorem

A graph $G$ is planar if and only if it contains no [[Subdivision|subdivision]] of either $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$.

```

<i>Proof.</i> Kuratowski's theorem is [[Kuratowski's and Wagner's Theorems are Equivalent|equivalent]] to [[Wagner's Theorem]]. According to Bondy and Murty, Wagner's theorem (formulated in terms of [[Graph Minor|minors]]) is easier to prove, so we prove that instead.
