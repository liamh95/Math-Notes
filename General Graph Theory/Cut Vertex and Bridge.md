## Cut Vertex

```ad-definition
title: Cut Vertex

A vertex $v$ of a graph $G$ is a **cut vertex** if its removal increases the number of connected components of $G$.

In other words, $v$ is a cut vertex if $\{x\}$ is a [[Separator#$k$-Separator|separating set]] of some component of $G$.

An edge $e$ of a graph $G$ is a **bridge** if its removal increases the number of connected components of $G$.
