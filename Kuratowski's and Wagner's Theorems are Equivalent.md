```ad-theorem
title: Kuratowski's and Wagner's Theorems are Equivalent

[[Kuratowski's Theorem]] and [[Wagner's Theorem]] are equivalent.

```

<i>Proof.</i> First note that any graph that contains an $F$-subdivision also has an $F$-minor: delete the vertices and edges not in the subdivision, then contract each subdivided edge into a single edge. Hence, Kuratowski implies Wagner.
