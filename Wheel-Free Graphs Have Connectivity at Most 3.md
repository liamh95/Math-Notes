## Statement

```ad-proposition
title: Wheel-Free Graphs Have Connectivity at Most 3

If $G$ is a 4-connected graph, then every vertex $v \in V(G)$ is the center of at least one [[Wheel Graph#Definition|wheel]]. In particular, a wheel-free graph has [[k-Connectivity#Connectivity|connectivity]] at most 3.
