```ad-definition
title: Blossom

Let $G$ be a graph and $M$ a matching in $G$. A **blossom** is a cycle with $2k+1$ edges, exactly $k$ of which belong to $M$ and one of the vertices $v$ of the cycle (the base) is such there exists an $M$-alternating path of even length (the stem) from $v$ to a free (unmatched) vertex.
