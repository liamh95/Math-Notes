## (a)

How many possibilities are there to distribute $k$ forints among $n$ people so that each receives at least one?

### Solution

Imagine laying the $k$ forints out in a line. We place dividers between segments of forints to denote whom they should go to. In order to distribute these to $n$ people, we need to place $n-1$ dividers in the $k-1$ gaps between the individual forints. There are $\binom{k-1}{n-1}$ ways to do this.


## (b)
Suppose that we do not insist that each person receives something. What will be the number of distributions in this case?
