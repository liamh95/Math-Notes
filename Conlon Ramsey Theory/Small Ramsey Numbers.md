title: Small Ramsey Numbers

By [[Ramsey Number Binomial Coefficient Bound]], we have that $r(3, 3) \leq 6$. To see that this is sharp, color $K_5$ in the following way. Color the edges of some 5-cycle red and color the remaining edges blue. Notice that the complement of a 5-cycle is also a 5-cycle, so the blue edges are also a 5-cycle. The red and blue subgraphs are both triangle free.
