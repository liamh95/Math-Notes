title: Structure Theorems for 3-Connected Graphs

A graph is 3-connected if and only if it is a wheel or can be obtained from a wheel by repeated applications of the following two operations.
1. The addition of an edge
2. The replacement of a vertex $x$ of degree $\geq 4$ by two adjacent vertices $x',x''$ and joining every neighbor of $x$ to exactly one of $x',x''$ in such a way that both $x'$ and $x''$ will have degree $\geq 3$.
